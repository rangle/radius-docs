# Development

**The key to successful collaboration between developers and designers is continuous communication, mutual respect, and a shared understanding of the project objectives.**

Our collaborative approach ensures that the Design System you’re building is both visually appealing and technically sound. We outline things like: token naming conventions, handoff specifications, collaboration and creation checklists, to name a few – to allow for the smoothest way of working.
